### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a fourth year Data Science and Computer Science major at the University of Chicago, and in my free time, I work on Sports Analytics Projects. Feel free to look through my code, and check out the links in my bio for more in-depth sports analysis! The image below is from my DataEthicsIP repository.
